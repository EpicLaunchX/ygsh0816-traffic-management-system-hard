## üåê Preferred: Cloud Development with GitHub Codespaces

> **Recommended!**
> For the easiest and most reliable onboarding, **use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** for a one-click, cloud-based development environment. This is the preferred way to do tasks in this project.
>
> Just click the **"Code"** button at the top of this repository and select **"Create codespace on main"**. All dependencies and tools will be set up automatically!

## ‚úÖ First Steps Checklist

> **Note:** If you use GitHub Codespaces (preferred), some of these steps are handled automatically and can be skipped (e.g., environment setup and dependency installation).

- [ ] Accept the invitation for being a collaborator in this repo
- [ ] Clone the repo *(Codespaces: done for you)*
- [ ] Create and activate virtualenv *(Codespaces: done for you)*

### Option 2: Manual Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make install-flit
   make install-dev
   ```

4. **Activate pre-commit hooks**
    ```bash
    make enable-pre-commit-hooks
    ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## ü™ü Windows Users

If you are on Windows and can't use `make`, you have two options:

1. **Recommended:** Use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) to run Makefile commands.
2. **Manual:** Run the equivalent Python commands below:

| Make Command         | Manual Command(s)                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| make install-flit    | python -m pip install flit==3.8.0                                                 |
| make install-dev     | python -m flit install -s --env --deps=develop --symlink                          |
| make test            | python -m pytest -svvv -m "not slow and not integration" tests                    |
| make format          | see [Makefile](./Makefile)                                                        |
